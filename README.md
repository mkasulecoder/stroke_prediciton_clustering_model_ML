## Data

The model uses the 'healthcare-dataset-stroke-data.csv' file, which includes the following features:

- id
- gender
- age
- hypertension
- heart_disease
- ever_married
- work_type
- Residence_type
- avg_glucose_level
- bmi
- smoking_status
- stroke

## Methodology

1. Data Preprocessing:
- Removal of unnecessary columns
- Handling missing data
- Standardization of numerical features

2. Clustering:
- K-means clustering is applied to identify patterns in the data
- The optimal number of clusters is determined using the elbow method

3. Analysis:
- Visualization of clusters
- Interpretation of results in the context of stroke prediction
